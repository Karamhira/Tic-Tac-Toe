# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player board game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbol (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
In this code, you can play Tic Tac Toe games in the console. The game allows players to take turns placing their symbol on the board until one of them gets three in a row or all of the spaces on the board are filled. If a player gets three in a row, they are declared the winner. If all of the spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
